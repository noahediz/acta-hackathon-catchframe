CatchFrame is a simple bug reporting tool that records a user's screen, so you can see exactly what went wrong. It's the easiest way to get bug reports that actually help you solve problems faster. Just embed a static javascript on all your pages and the user is able to report a bug instantly: ``<script src="https://app.catchframe.app/scripts/widget.js" defer></script>``

## The Problem

*"The button doesn't work."*  

We've all gotten bug reports like this. They don't tell you what's really happening, so you waste hours asking questions, guessing the user's browser, and hoping you can see the bug for yourself.

It's a slow, frustrating process for everyone. Also on BETA system we don't really have a good feedback loop. It would be very helpful and timesaving if users directly can submit a bug. User saves time and the developer headach.

## The Solution

Why does the user not just record the problem and you receive all information, like console logs, metadata, network traffic?

CatchFrame makes bug reporting easy. Just add **one line of code** to your website.

When a user sees a bug, they click the CatchFrame widget and record their screen. You instantly get a complete report in your team's dashboard.

With CatchFrame, you get:

- A video of what the user did  
- All the console logs and errors  
- A list of any failed network requests  
- Info about their browser and operating system  

You'll understand the problem in **minutes, not days**.
